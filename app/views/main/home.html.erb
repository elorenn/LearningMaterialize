				      <h4>The Fitzpatrick Skin Type</h4>
				      <p>
				       	<h5>Do you know your skin type?</h5> 
						Your skin type is one of the main factors in your risk for skin cancer. There are six skin phototypes, going from very fair (Type I) to the very dark (Type VI). Color and tone vary a lot within each skin type, but it is a useful guide. Certain types of skin are at greater risk for developing sun damage and skin cancer. Individuals with skin types I and II face the highest risk of developing skin cancer, while types V and VI are at the lowest risk.  That is because those with more pigmentation have more natural protection from the sun.  However, people with darker skin can nonetheless get skin cancer. Like light-skinned people, they should be cautious of the sun and have regular examinations by a doctor. </p>

You are extremely susceptible to skin damage as well as cancers like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. You are also at very high risk for melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer. Generally follow The Skin Cancer Foundation's prevention tips but use a sunscreen with a SPF of 30+ and clothing with a UPF rating of 30 or higher. Seek the shade whenever you are out in the sun. Check your skin head-to-toe each month, paying careful attention to any suspicious growths, and make sure you have an annual professional skin checkup.</p></div>

You are susceptible to skin damage as well as cancers like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. You are also at risk for melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer. Be sure to apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 every day, wear sun-protective clothing, and seek the shade between 10 AM and 4 PM, when the sun is strongest. Check your skin head-to-toe each month, paying careful attention to any suspicious growths, and make sure you have an annual professional skin checkup.</p></div>

Acral lentiginous melanoma, a very virulent form of the disease, is more common among darker-skinned people. These melanomas tend to appear on parts of the body not often exposed to the sun, and often remain undetected until after the cancer has spread. Check your skin head-to-toe each month, paying careful attention to any suspicious growths, and make sure you have an annual professional skin checkup.
