              <p>
                <h5>Do you know your skin type?</h5> 
            Your skin type is one of the main factors in your risk for skin cancer. There are six skin phototypes, going from very fair (Type I) to the very dark (Type VI). Color and tone vary a lot within each skin type, but it is a useful guide. Certain types of skin are at greater risk for developing sun damage and skin cancer. Individuals with skin types I and II face the highest risk of developing skin cancer, while types V and VI are at the lowest risk.  That is because those with more pigmentation have more natural protection from the sun.  However, people with darker skin can nonetheless get skin cancer. Like light-skinned people, they should be cautious of the sun and have regular examinations by a doctor. </p>
